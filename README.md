# json-formatter
Rewrites non-human readable json files to be readable.  Primary reason for this is to compare lines of one json to another

# Usage
**Needs** to run from the command line, you pass an argument "-f" preceding the name of the json file you're trying to convert.  It will spit your file back out as SomeFileName-formatted.json.
